# Leetcode-1980-Binary-Reading-the-Question-

A fresh problem to me, since I haven't really worked with binary conversion and stuff like that.
The hint is misleading again, I only came out with a not-really-good solution with that. 

In short, there is no need to change everything into base 10 numbers, we can simply compare the binary representations.
